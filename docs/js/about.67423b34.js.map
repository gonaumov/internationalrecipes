Just half the ingredients if for 2 people. It can stored for upto\n      24 hours and reheated.It has two parts: main dish is lentils and rice soup and an optional\n      side dish which is mashed potatoes.\n    </p>\n    <img alt=\"Vue logo\" src=\"../assets/khichdi.png\" />\n    Ingredients\n    • 250 gm of Rice (Basmati, Thai, Jasmine or simple parboiled rice)\n    •\n    • 200gm of yellow Moong lentils or red lentils (you can use a mix of lentils)\n    Turmeric powder 1 tablespoon\n    • Salt\n    • 2 Bay leaves\n    •\n    • 1 or 2 chopped tomato\n    1 teaspoon garlic paste\n    • 1 teaspoon ginger paste\n    • 4 medium sized Potatoes\n    • 2 teaspoon Cumin seeds\n    • 2 chopped onions\n    •\n    • Fresh coriander leaves (optional)\n    Mustard oil\n    • Ghee\n\n    Instructions\n    1) Put Rice and lentils of your choice to a large pot and rinse it properly until water\n    becomes clear. Add 2.5-liter water (approx. 4 times volume of rice and lentils).\n    Add 1 teaspoon turmeric, 2 bay leaves, salt according to taste, 1 teaspoon of ginger\n    paste, 1 teaspoon of garlic paste, 1 or 2 chopped tomatoes\n    2) Under medium heat, cook for 30 to 45 minutes. Keep stirring and checking that it\n    is properly cooked. Alternatively, in a pressure cooker, it will take exactly 22\n    minutes.3) In parallel we can prepare garnish for the Khichdi which is added when khichdi is\n    done. For this, heat (medium) Ghee (butter schmalz) in a pan and add cumin\n    seeds. After cumin seeds are slightly roasted (20 seconds), add one chopped green\n    chili, 2 chopped onion, you can add garlic and ginger paste and roast hem until\n    golden brown. Switch off the heat, add fresh coriander leaves and quickly add it in\n    the khichdi. Coriander is optional.\n    4) If you like to also make side dish which tastes very good when combined with\n    main dish. Boil potatoes. After it is properly boiled, strain the hot water and cool\n    off the potatoes under cold water. Peel of the potatoes with hands (it comes off\n    very easily). Add salt to potatoes and mash it properly without lumps.\n    5) For garnishing the potatoes, heat mustard oil and then add cumin seed to it. Fry it\n    for 30 seconds. Then add 1 chopped chili, 1 or 2 onions , roast until pink brown.\n    Add this to mashed potatoes. Allow it to cool off and then mix it properly.\n    6) To make this dish even more healthy, I try to add some vegetables like peas,\n    chopped zucchini, or spinach in step 1.\n    7) The side dish can be replaced by plain Joghurt.\n    Motto of Khichdi\n    Healthy and tasty food does not need to be expensive\n    Enjoy\n    &#9786;\n  </div>\n</template>\n","import { render } from \"./India.vue?vue&type=template&id=745ac668\"\nconst script = {}\nscript.render = render\n\nexport default script","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"img/banicharnica.730e885f.png\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"img/pumpkinRisottowithChorizo2.89d01918.png\";","<template>\n  <div class=\"about\">\n    <h1>This is Bulgaria page</h1>\n    Banitsa was one of dishes last evening in my house. Banitsa is a traditional\n    Bulgarian pasta dish. In Bulgaria this is a favorite breakfast. There are\n    many places where you can buy a banitsa for breakfast in the morning. They\n    are called banitcharnici. This is how a typical banicharnica looks:\n    <img alt=\"Vue logo\" src=\"../assets/banicharnica.png\" />\n    Batinsa consists of rolled or arranged in layers sheets of rolled dough or\n    ready- made pie crusts with stuffing. There is a funny expression that\n    people of the older generation use when they want to ask if a hard job will\n    be completed. They ask &quot;Will Hassan eat a banitsa?&quot; It is usually\n    baked in the oven. Different fillings are used - most often cheese or\n    cottage cheese, with or without the addition of eggs. Banitsas are also made\n    with vegetables, meat and fruits. How to prepare it? This is how we prepared\n    it in my home last evening: Ingredients: 4 eggs - they have to be a room\n    temperature 1 pack of yogurt - 400 g 300-400 g cheese 1 tsp baking soda 1/2\n    pack of melted butter Sheets phyllo dough, thawed 1. Mix eggs, cheese,\n    yogurt and baking soda in a bowl , combine and stir ingredients well. 2. Put\n    down 2 sheets of phyllo dough down in buttered and brush over with melted\n    butter 3. Pour enough of the mixture to cover phyllo sheets and top with 2\n    more sheets. 4. Repeat the process. The last 2 phyllo sheets should be not\n    covered with the mixture. 5. Bake for 25-35 minutes or until golden, make\n    sure mixture is cooked in the middle by cutting into banitsa. When the\n    mixture is cooked it will not be runny. 6. Once banitsa is done cover it\n    with either a towell or the lid to the pan and let it sit and cool before\n    cutting it or serving. Covering it lets the steam soften the phyllo dough\n    sheets. 7. Enjoy the banitsa!\n    <img alt=\"Vue logo\" src=\"../assets/banica.png\" />\n    This is the banitsa which we eat last evening.\n  </div>\n</template>\n","import { render } from \"./Bulgaria.vue?vue&type=template&id=ffb24304\"\nconst script = {}\nscript.render = render\n\nexport default script","<template>\n  <div class=\"about\">\n    <h1>Pumpkin Risotto with Chorizo</h1>\n    This dish is not a standard German dish, but it I received it from Germany.\n    Risotto is incredibly flexible, can be combined with almost anything and\n    ideally contains so much cheese that it always makes you happy. And since we\n    usually have Spanish sausages at home, we add them on top. A little more\n    umami never &#9786;\n    <img\n      alt=\"RisottowithChorizo logo\"\n      src=\"../assets/pumpkinRisottowithChorizo.png\"\n    />\n    Ingredients (for two) 250g Risotto rice (e.g. Arborio) 600ml Vegetable broth\n    100ml White wine + more for the cook 1/2 Pumpkin 3 Chorizo 1 Onion 30g\n    Butter Olive oil A lot of Parmigiano Reggiano Pumpkin seed oil Pumpkin seeds\n    Spices: salt, pepper, turmeric, coriander, cumin, paprika, ginger, cinnamon,\n    cayenne pepper, garlic Directions 1. Get your mise-en-place done and prepare\n    all the ingredients. Cut the onion into small dices, cut the chorizo into\n    bite-sized pieces, and peel the squash if you like (you can usually eat the\n    peel with it, but I prefer it without). Also prepare your broth already (if\n    necessary) and grate of course a good portion of cheese. And btw if you\n    bought a white wine you don't know, now is the time to try it.\n    <img\n      alt=\"RisottowithChorizo logo\"\n      src=\"../assets/pumpkinRisottowithChorizo1.png\"\n    />\n    <img\n      alt=\"RisottowithChorizo logo\"\n      src=\"../assets/pumpkinRisottowithChorizo2.png\"\n    />\n    2. Season the pumpkin to your preference and mix it with a little olive oil.\n    Then put it in the oven at about 180 degrees on a tray. It should take about\n    20 minutes until it is ready. 3. Heat the butter with olive oil and add the\n    onion and risotto rice. Sauté until both the rice and the onions are\n    slightly transparent. 4. Now deglaze the whole thing with white wine and\n    stir on medium heat until the rice has almost completely absorbed the\n    liquid. 5. Now add the broth in several steps, reducing everything each time\n    before adding new liquid. And it applies: \"you can never stir enough\".\n    <img\n      alt=\"RisottowithChorizo logo\"\n      src=\"../assets/pumpkinRisottowithChorizo3.png\"\n    />\n    <img\n      alt=\"RisottowithChorizo logo\"\n      src=\"../assets/pumpkinRisottowithChorizo4.png\"\n    />\n    <img\n      alt=\"RisottowithChorizo logo\"\n      src=\"../assets/pumpkinRisottowithChorizo5.png\"\n    />\n    6. In the meantime, roast the pumpkin seeds in a pan and set them aside.\n    Then you can fry the chorizo in the same pan. 7. When the pumpkin is ready,\n    take some of the smaller cubes aside and blend the rest. Then add it to the\n    risotto with the grated cheese. Stir everything well and most of it is done.\n    8. Now put the rice on the plate, sprinkle the small pieces of pumpkin &\n    chorizo plus the pumpkin seeds on top. Add a little cheese and pumpkin seed\n    oil as desired and you're ready to eat.
