Add 2.5-liter water (approx. 4 times volume of rice and lentils). Add 1 teaspoon turmeric, 2 bay leaves, salt according to taste, 1 teaspoon of ginger paste, 1 teaspoon of garlic paste, 1 or 2 chopped tomatoes 2) Under medium heat, cook for 30 to 45 minutes. Keep stirring and checking that it is properly cooked. Alternatively, in a pressure cooker, it will take exactly 22 minutes.3) In parallel we can prepare garnish for the Khichdi which is added when khichdi is done. For this, heat (medium) Ghee (butter schmalz) in a pan and add cumin seeds. After cumin seeds are slightly roasted (20 seconds), add one chopped green chili, 2 chopped onion, you can add garlic and ginger paste and roast hem until golden brown. Switch off the heat, add fresh coriander leaves and quickly add it in the khichdi. Coriander is optional. 4) If you like to also make side dish which tastes very good when combined with main dish. Boil potatoes. After it is properly boiled, strain the hot water and cool off the potatoes under cold water. Peel of the potatoes with hands (it comes off very easily). Add salt to potatoes and mash it properly without lumps. 5) For garnishing the potatoes, heat mustard oil and then add cumin seed to it. Fry it for 30 seconds. Then add 1 chopped chili, 1 or 2 onions , roast until pink brown. Add this to mashed potatoes. Allow it to cool off and then mix it properly. 6) To make this dish even more healthy, I try to add some vegetables like peas, chopped zucchini, or spinach in step 1. 7) The side dish can be replaced by plain Joghurt.

Different fillings are used - most often cheese or cottage cheese, with or without the addition of eggs. Banitsas are also made with vegetables, meat and fruits. How to prepare it? This is how we prepared it in my home last evening: Ingredients: 4 eggs - they have to be a room temperature 1 pack of yogurt - 400 g 300-400 g cheese 1 tsp baking soda 1/2 pack of melted butter Sheets phyllo dough, thawed 1. Mix eggs, cheese, yogurt and baking soda in a bowl , combine and stir ingredients well. 2. Put down 2 sheets of phyllo dough down in buttered and brush over with melted butter 3. Pour enough of the mixture to cover phyllo sheets and top with 2 more sheets. 4. Repeat the process. The last 2 phyllo sheets should be not covered with the mixture. 5. Bake for 25-35 minutes or until golden, make sure mixture is cooked in the middle by cutting into banitsa. When the mixture is cooked it will not be runny. 6. Once banitsa is done cover it with either a towell or the lid to the pan and let it sit and cool before cutting it or serving. Covering it lets the steam soften the phyllo dough sheets. 7.
