    Ingredients
    • 250 gm of Rice (Basmati, Thai, Jasmine or simple parboiled rice)
    •
    • 200gm of yellow Moong lentils or red lentils (you can use a mix of lentils)
    Turmeric powder 1 tablespoon
    • Salt
    • 2 Bay leaves
    •
    • 1 or 2 chopped tomato
    1 teaspoon garlic paste
    • 1 teaspoon ginger paste
    • 4 medium sized Potatoes
    • 2 teaspoon Cumin seeds
    • 2 chopped onions
    •
    • Fresh coriander leaves (optional)
    Mustard oil
    • Ghee

    Instructions
    1) Put Rice and lentils of your choice to a large pot and rinse it properly until water
    becomes clear. Add 2.5-liter water (approx. 4 times volume of rice and lentils).
    Add 1 teaspoon turmeric, 2 bay leaves, salt according to taste, 1 teaspoon of ginger
    paste, 1 teaspoon of garlic paste, 1 or 2 chopped tomatoes
    2) Under medium heat, cook for 30 to 45 minutes. Keep stirring and checking that it
    is properly cooked. Alternatively, in a pressure cooker, it will take exactly 22
    minutes.3) In parallel we can prepare garnish for the Khichdi which is added when khichdi is
    done. For this, heat (medium) Ghee (butter schmalz) in a pan and add cumin
    seeds. After cumin seeds are slightly roasted (20 seconds), add one chopped green
    chili, 2 chopped onion, you can add garlic and ginger paste and roast hem until
    golden brown. Switch off the heat, add fresh coriander leaves and quickly add it in
    the khichdi. Coriander is optional.
    4) If you like to also make side dish which tastes very good when combined with
    main dish. Boil potatoes. After it is properly boiled, strain the hot water and cool
    off the potatoes under cold water. Peel of the potatoes with hands (it comes off
    very easily). Add salt to potatoes and mash it properly without lumps.
    5) For garnishing the potatoes, heat mustard oil and then add cumin seed to it. Fry it
    for 30 seconds. Then add 1 chopped chili, 1 or 2 onions , roast until pink brown.
    Add this to mashed potatoes. Allow it to cool off and then mix it properly.
    6) To make this dish even more healthy, I try to add some vegetables like peas,
    chopped zucchini, or spinach in step 1.
    7) The side dish can be replaced by plain Joghurt.
