    Banitsa was one of dishes last evening in my house. Banitsa is a traditional
    Bulgarian pasta dish. In Bulgaria this is a favorite breakfast. There are
    many places where you can buy a banitsa for breakfast in the morning. They
    are called banitcharnici. This is how a typical banicharnica looks:

    Batinsa consists of rolled or arranged in layers sheets of rolled dough or
    ready- made pie crusts with stuffing. There is a funny expression that
    people of the older generation use when they want to ask if a hard job will
    be completed. They ask &quot;Will Hassan eat a banitsa?&quot; It is usually
    baked in the oven. Different fillings are used - most often cheese or
    cottage cheese, with or without the addition of eggs. Banitsas are also made
    with vegetables, meat and fruits. How to prepare it? This is how we prepared
    it in my home last evening: Ingredients: 4 eggs - they have to be a room
    temperature 1 pack of yogurt - 400 g 300-400 g cheese 1 tsp baking soda 1/2
    pack of melted butter Sheets phyllo dough, thawed 1. Mix eggs, cheese,
    yogurt and baking soda in a bowl , combine and stir ingredients well. 2. Put
    down 2 sheets of phyllo dough down in buttered and brush over with melted
    butter 3. Pour enough of the mixture to cover phyllo sheets and top with 2
    more sheets. 4. Repeat the process. The last 2 phyllo sheets should be not
    covered with the mixture. 5. Bake for 25-35 minutes or until golden, make
    sure mixture is cooked in the middle by cutting into banitsa. When the
    mixture is cooked it will not be runny. 6. Once banitsa is done cover it
    with either a towell or the lid to the pan and let it sit and cool before
    cutting it or serving. Covering it lets the steam soften the phyllo dough
    sheets. 7. Enjoy the banitsa!
