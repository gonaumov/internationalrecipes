    <h1>Pumpkin Risotto with Chorizo</h1>
    This dish is not a standard German dish, but it I received it from Germany.
    Risotto is incredibly flexible, can be combined with almost anything and
    ideally contains so much cheese that it always makes you happy. And since we
    usually have Spanish sausages at home, we add them on top. A little more
    umami never &#9786;

    Ingredients (for two) 250g Risotto rice (e.g. Arborio) 600ml Vegetable broth
    100ml White wine + more for the cook 1/2 Pumpkin 3 Chorizo 1 Onion 30g
    Butter Olive oil A lot of Parmigiano Reggiano Pumpkin seed oil Pumpkin seeds
    Spices: salt, pepper, turmeric, coriander, cumin, paprika, ginger, cinnamon,
    cayenne pepper, garlic Directions 1. Get your mise-en-place done and prepare
    all the ingredients. Cut the onion into small dices, cut the chorizo into
    bite-sized pieces, and peel the squash if you like (you can usually eat the
    peel with it, but I prefer it without). Also prepare your broth already (if
    necessary) and grate of course a good portion of cheese. And btw if you
    bought a white wine you don't know, now is the time to try it.

    2. Season the pumpkin to your preference and mix it with a little olive oil.
    Then put it in the oven at about 180 degrees on a tray. It should take about
    20 minutes until it is ready. 3. Heat the butter with olive oil and add the
    onion and risotto rice. Saut√© until both the rice and the onions are
    slightly transparent. 4. Now deglaze the whole thing with white wine and
    stir on medium heat until the rice has almost completely absorbed the
    liquid. 5. Now add the broth in several steps, reducing everything each time
    before adding new liquid. And it applies: "you can never stir enough".

    6. In the meantime, roast the pumpkin seeds in a pan and set them aside.
    Then you can fry the chorizo in the same pan. 7. When the pumpkin is ready,
    take some of the smaller cubes aside and blend the rest. Then add it to the
    risotto with the grated cheese. Stir everything well and most of it is done.
    8. Now put the rice on the plate, sprinkle the small pieces of pumpkin &
    chorizo plus the pumpkin seeds on top. Add a little cheese and pumpkin seed
    oil as desired and you're ready to eat. Enjoy it!
