    <h3>Strawberry Sauce:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>300g Strawberries</li>
      <li>Sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Preparation:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Melt the butter and mix everything into a big pot.</li>
      <li>Put them into the fridge.</li>
      <li>Grab a coffee or two (30 min)</li>
      <li>Heat up water until it boils</li>
      <li>Form dumplings with your hands. Pro Tip: Wash them before.</li>
      <li>Cook them ~15minutes.</li>
      <li>
        In the meantime, take the strawberries, use a blender/mixer to make a
        sauce out of them. Add sugar to your liking.
      </li>
      <li>
        Optional: You can take the breadcrumbs, put them into a pan and roast
        them. After you get the dumplings out of the water, you can put them
        into the breadcrumbs and turn them around until they are all covered, or
        for the lazy ones like me, just add them last on top while serving.
      </li>
      <li>Serve and eat them.</li>
      <li>
        Get on the couch, or go for a walk, because you thought it’s only a
        dessert and they turned out way bigger than you expected.
      </li>
      <li>Profit</li>
